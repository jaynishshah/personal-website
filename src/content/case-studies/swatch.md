SWATCH is [Nykaa's](https://www.nykaa.com) multi-brand design system. It's built from ground up to bring consistency and efficiency at scale in front-end development across business verticals. Earlier existing as a style guide, I led the initiative of building it into a thriving design system.

## How it started

Previously, there wasn't a dedicated team working on a design system. Usage guidelines for foundations were in place to help designers. The guidelines also stated UI components, their variants and their suggested usage.

## What we wanted to solve with SWATCH

### Flexibility

Make SWATCH a breathing system that gives designers and developers flexibility to experiment but not at the cost of usability.

### Scalability

Enable teams to build for newer business verticals easily and ensure consistency across the portfolio.

### Promote contribution

By putting the right protocols in place, encourage others to contribute towards the design system.
