2 years back, I wrote a newsletter titled 'Be a generalist'.

> "In a world full of specialists, be a generalist. Be the person who can create just about anything, solve just about any problem, or if not, know someone who they can work with to solve the problem. It's liberating."
>

This still holds.

*I pursued my master's degree in interaction design from Domus Academy, Milan.*

It's been six years since I transitioned from architecture to interaction design. The pivot began with a postgraduate degree in interaction design. The course exposed us to all the possible domains to pursue one's career. Tinkering with hardware, experimenting with (then) emerging tech such as AR / VR, creative coding etc — we dabbled with them all. After the course, I wanted to work in a space where I could apply these emerging technologies to enhance spatial experiences.

Easier said than done.

## Diverge

I returned to India and joined [Animal](https://www.weareanimal.co), a creative agency based out of India. Being a creative agency, their portfolio comprised visual design, branding, and identity projects. To keep myself relevant to where I was, I did everything it took to move a project forward. Creating illustrations, guidelines, and storyboarding only helped me hone my craft. Whenever website projects came in, it gave me a better edge and helped me approach them holistically. Conventional parts of digital product design took a back seat. I self-taught these with every website project that came my way.

*Veu was a platform to hire photographers for various occasions.*

We also built a digital product from scratch. Veu was a platform for hiring photographers for various occasions. Building a digital product was uncharted waters for everyone on the team. However, we pushed through. The product didn't kick off. We lacked a product-market fit. We didn't iterate enough on our marketing strategy. We shipped slowly. We didn't have a roadmap.

However, we tried.

When imposter syndrome hit, I resorted to learning to code. I'd heard that designers should know to code. I started Command Space, an Instagram page where I posted my experiments with processing, P5js and TouchDesigner.

I share this because I believe that had I stuck to my conventional thoughts of what I should've been doing just because of my title or role, I wouldn't have known what else I could be good at. I am glad that I got to diverge and stretch my skills across multiple mediums in the starting years. Exposing myself to various parts of a design process helped me identify the parts I enjoyed the most.

I knew I wanted to grow further into digital product design. It needed to be a place where my work directly impacts business metrics. A place where we ask deeper product questions and seek answers through intense research.

## Converge

This led me to join [Nykaa](https://www.nykaa.com/), India's largest lifestyle e-commerce company. Here I worked on research projects that helped us improve the after-purchase experience. The help center redesign was a direct initiative that stemmed from this research.
